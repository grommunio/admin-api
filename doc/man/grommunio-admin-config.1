.SH Commands
.SS check
.PP
Check the structural validity of the configuration.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Does currently not validate the semantic integrity, i.e.
existence of referenced files, LDAP or database connectivity etc.,
although this functionality may be added in the future.
.SS dump, get
.PP
Print the complete configuration.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
As the grommunio-admin configuration can (and probably will) be
distributed over multiple files, the get command provides an easy way to
see the effective configuration.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The output can be reduced to a single \f[I]KEY\f[R], if specified.
Sub-levels can be specified in dotted notation
(e.g.\ \f[C]sync.defaultPolicy\f[R])
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The \f[I]dump\f[R] command is an alias for \f[I]get\f[R] and remains for
backward compatibility.
.SS trace
.PP
Trace source of effective configuration.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Results can be presented either by file (\f[C]files\f[R]), showing which
parts of a file are actually used, or by value (\f[C]values\f[R]),
showing which file each value originates from.

Installation of the Python \f[C]termcolor\f[R] package is advised for a
more readable output.
See section \f[I]Tracing\f[R] for more information.
.SH Options
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]KEY\f[B]\f[R]
Only view specified key.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]-s\f[B]\f[R], \f[B]\f[CB]--show-history\f[B]\f[R]
Display more value history (see section \f[I]Tracing\f[R] for more
information)
.SH Tracing
.SS By-File
.PP
Print annotated contents of each file.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Each line is marked and color coded to show its status.
The following annotations are used:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]+\f[R], green: The value is part of the final configuration
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]x\f[R], red: The value is overwritten by a later file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]*\f[R], yellow: The object or list is extended by a later file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]\[ti]\f[R], grey: The value is overwritten with the same value
.PP
Additionally, lines overwriting or extending previous entries are
printed in boldface.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
When specifying \f[I]--show-history\f[R], each value that is overwritten
or extended is annotated with the files doing so (each being color coded
with the effect it has on the value).
.SS By-Value
.PP
Print annotated effective configuration.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Each line is annotated with the file it originates from.
In case of objects and lists, all contributing files are listed.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
When specifying \f[I]--show-history\f[R], overwritten files containing
that value are listed as well.
The effective source file is underlined.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
For better visualization, color coding is done on a per-file basis: Each
file is assigned an individual style which is used for its
contributions.
Objects and lists originating from multiple files are always shown in
boldface white.
